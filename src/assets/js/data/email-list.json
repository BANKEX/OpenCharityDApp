I know. Somehow...I've always known. Then you know why I have to face him.</p><p>Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict within you. Let goof your hate. It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature of the Force. He is your master now. Then my father is truly dead.</p><p>Thank you</p>",
